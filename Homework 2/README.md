In this homework I applied supervised learning - Linear Regression method using Scikit-learn package. Here, I build a regression model that would be trained on training data and for later to predict the price. Later I used Principal Component Analysis to make the model even better and less complex. In the last section I checked that if the model was overfitting or not by using cross-validation.
